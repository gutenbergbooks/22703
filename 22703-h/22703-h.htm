    <p>
      The train slackened, a brakeman thrust his head in at the door and shouted
      &ldquo;Bah,&rdquo;&mdash;a mysterious formality observed on American trains as they
      enter towns,&mdash;and an elderly lady, two drummers, and a young man with
      a satchel got out, followed by the languid envy of the other passengers,
      who had longer or shorter penances of heat and dust before them. The train
      got under way again, while the knot of loafers about the station proceeded
      to eye the arrivals as judicially as if they were a committee of safety to
      protect the village from invasion by doubtful characters. The old lady,
      apparently laboring under some such impression, regarded them
      deferentially, as nervous travelers on arriving in strange places
      generally do regard everybody who seems to feel at home. The drummers
      briskly disappeared down the main street, each anxious to anticipate the
      other at the stores. The young man with the satchel, however, did not get
      away till he had shaken hands and exchanged a few good-natured inquiries
      with one of the loungers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's that, Bill?&rdquo; asked one of the group, staring after the retreating
      figure with lazy curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, did n't you know him? Thought everybody knew him. That's Arthur
      Steele,&rdquo; replied the one who had shaken hands, in a tone of cordiality
      indicating that his politeness had left a pleasant impression on his mind,
      as Arthur Steele's politeness generally did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he, anyhow?&rdquo; pursued the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he 's a Fairfield boy&rdquo; (the brakeman pronounced it &ldquo;Bah&rdquo;), &ldquo;born and
      brought up here. His folks allers lived right next to mine, and now he's
      doin' a rushin' lawyer trade down New York, and I expect he's just rakin'
      the stamps. Did yer see that diamond pin he wore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S'pose it's genooine?&rdquo; asked a third loafer, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course it was. I tell you he's on the make, and don't you forgit it. Some
      fellers allers has luck. Many 's the time he 'n' I 've been in swim-min'
      and hookin' apples together when we wuz little chaps,&rdquo; pursued Bill, in a
      tone implying a mild reproach at the deceitfulness of an analogy that
      after such fair promise in early life had failed to complete itself in
      their later fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, darn it all, you know him, Jim,&rdquo; he continued, dropping the tone of
      pensive reminiscence into which he had momentarily allowed himself to
      fall. &ldquo;That pretty gal that sings in the Baptis' choir is his sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a space of silent rumination and jerking of peanut shells upon the
      track, the group broke up its session, and adjourned by tacit
      understanding till the next train was due.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Steele was half an hour in getting to his father's house, because
      everybody he met on the street insisted on shaking hands with him.
      Everybody in Fairfield had known him since he was a boy, and had seen him
      grow up, and all were proud of him as a credit to the village and one of
      its most successful representatives in the big outside world. The young
      man had sense and sentiment enough to feel that the place he held in the
      esteem of his native community was a thing to feel more just pride in than
      any station he could win in the city, and as he walked along hand-shaking
      with old friends on this side and that, it was about his idea of a
      triumphal entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the dear old house, and as he saw it his memory of it started
      out vividly in his mind as if to attest how faithfully it had kept each
      detail. It never would come out so clearly at times when he was far away
      and needed its comfort. He opened the door softly. The sitting-room was
      empty, and darkened to keep out the heat and flies. The latched door stood
      open, and, hearing voices, he tiptoed across the floor with a guileful
      smile and, leaning through the doorway, saw his mother and sister sitting
      by the cool, lilac-shaded window, picking over currants for tea, and
      talking tranquilly. Being a provident young man, he paused a minute to let
      the pretty, peaceful scene impress itself upon his mind, to be remembered
      afterward for the cheer of bleak boarding-house Sunday afternoons. Then
      there was a sudden glancing up, a cry of joyful consternation, and the pan
      of currants rolled from Amy's lap like a broken necklace of rubies across
      the uncarpeted floor, while Arthur held mother and sister in a double
      embrace. And when at length the kissing had all been done, he established
      himself in his familiar boyish attitude on the window-seat, kicking his
      heels against the mopboard, with his elbows on his knees, and the three
      talked away steadily till the shop-bell rang, and Mrs. Steele sprang up in
      a panic, exclaiming: &ldquo;Father will be here in five minutes, and the
      currants are on the floor. Come, Amy, quick; we must pick some more, and
      you shall help, Arthur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But though he went out into the garden with them readily enough, it was
      quite another thing to make him pick currants, for he insisted on
      wandering all over the place and demanding what had become of everything
      he missed, and the history of everything new. And pretty soon Mr. Steele
      also appeared in the garden, having found no one in the house on reaching
      home. He had learned on the street that Arthur had arrived, and came out
      beaming. It was good to see the hearty affection with which the two shook
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transition of the son from the pupilage of childhood and youth to the
      independence of manhood is often trying to the filial relation. Neither
      party fully realizes that the old relation is at an end, or just what the
      new basis is, or when the change takes place. The absence of the son for
      two or three years at this period has often the best results. He goes a
      boy and returns a man; the old relation is forgotten by both parties, and
      they readily fall into the new one. So it had fared with Arthur and his
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got a splendid lot of watermelons,&rdquo; said the former, as they
      arrived at the upper end of the ample garden in their tour of inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mr. Steele, with a shrug; &ldquo;only thus far they've been
      stolen a little faster than they 've ripened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you plant them so near the fence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was my blunder; but you see the soil is just the thing, better than
      lower down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you buy a bulldog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it's more Christian to shoot a man outright than to set one of
      those devils on him. The breed ought to be extirpated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put some ipecac in one or two. That 'll fetch 'em. I know how sick it
      made me once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did; but more were stolen next night. I can't afford to medicate the
      whole village. Last night I sat up to watch till twelve o'clock, when
      mother made me go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll watch to-night,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;and give 'em a lesson with a good
      load of beans from the old shotgun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would n't pay,&rdquo; replied his father. &ldquo;I concluded last night that all
      the melons in the world were n't worth a night's sleep. They 'll have to
      go, and next year I 'll know more than to plant any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go and help Amy pick currants, and let me talk to the boy a little,&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Steele, coming up and taking Arthur off for a promenade up the
      broad path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How pretty Amy has grown,&rdquo; said he, glancing with a pleased smile at the
      girl as she looked up at her father. &ldquo;I suppose the young men are making
      sheep's eyes at her already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does n't do them any good if they are,&rdquo; said Mrs. Steele, decisively.
      &ldquo;She's only sixteen and a little girl yet, and has sense enough to know
      it.&rdquo; &ldquo;What had she been crying for when I arrived? I saw her eyes were as
      red as the currants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; replied Mrs. Steele, with a sigh of vexation, &ldquo;it was her
      troubles at the Seminary. You know we let her go as a day scholar this
      sum-mer. Some of the girls slight and snub her, and she is very unhappy
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what on earth can anybody have against Amy?&rdquo; demanded Arthur, in
      indignant surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it's because some of the little hussies from the city have
      taken the notion that they won't associate with a mechanic's daughter,
      although Amy is very careful not to say it in so many words, for fear of
      hurting my feelings. But I suspect that's about where the shoe pinches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur muttered something between an oath and a grunt, expressing the
      emphasis of the one and the disgust of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell Amy it is foolish to mind their airs, but I 'm really afraid it
      spoils the poor girl's happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you send her away to boarding-school, if it is so serious a
      matter as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't afford it,&rdquo; said his mother, whereto Arthur promptly replied:
      &mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'll pay her expenses. I 'm making a good deal more money than I know
      what to do with, and I 'd really like the chance of doing a little good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mother glanced at him with affectionate pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 're always wanting to pay somebody's expenses, or make somebody a
      present. It's really unsafe, when you 're around, to indicate that one is
      n't perfectly contented. But you caught me up too quickly. I was going to
      say that we could n't spare her from home, anyhow. She's the light of the
      house. Besides that, if it comes to objections, I 've my notions about
      boarding-schools, and I 'd trust no girl of mine at one that wasn't within
      sight of her home. No, she'll have to keep on here and bear it as she can,
      though it's pretty hard, I know. The trouble to-night was, that Lina
      Maynard, who is one of the older girls, has invited nearly everybody at
      the Seminary except Amy to a birthday party to-morrow. Little minx, I
      could shake her. And the worst of it is, Amy thinks there 's nobody like
      Lina Maynard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After tea it was still light, and Arthur and Amy went out to walk. In
      spite of the ten years difference in their ages, he always enjoyed her
      company as well as anybody's in the world, because she was so refreshingly
      childlike and natural. Every chord of feeling answered so true and clear
      to the touch, that to talk with her was like playing on a musical
      instrument, only far more delightful. Arthur had looked forward to walks
      and talks with Amy as among the jolliest treats of his vacation. She tried
      her best now to seem light-hearted, and to entertain him with the local
      gossip, for which he always depended on her. But she could n't simulate
      the vivacious and eager air that had been the chief charm of her talk. As
      he glanced down, he was grieved to see the sad set of the pretty child
      face at his side, and how still had grown the fountain of smiles in the
      hazel eyes that were wont to send their ripples outward in constant
      succession. It is to be feared that under his breath he applied some very
      ungentlemanly language to Lina Maynard and her clique, whose nonsenical
      ill-nature had hurt this little girl's feelings so sorely, and
      incidentally spoiled half the fun of his vacation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, you need n't talk any more,&rdquo; he finally said, rather
      rudely, half vexed with her, as helpful people are wont to be with those
      they can do nothing to help.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up in grieved surprise, but before he could speak again, they
      came face to face with a party of girls coming from the direction of the
      Seminary.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were six or seven of them, perhaps, but Arthur only got the
      impression of one and a lot of others. The one was a rather tall girl of
      lithe figure and unusually fine carriage. Her olive complexion was lighted
      with great black eyes that rested on you with an air of imperturbable
      assurance, as penetrating as it was negligent. She was talking, and her
      companions were listening and laughing. As they came face to face with
      Arthur and Amy, he saw that they barely noticed her, while glancing at him
      rather curiously, with the boldness of girls in a crowd of their own sex.
      They evidently observed that he was a stranger to the village, and of
      quite a different style from that of the country bumpkins and rural
      exquisites they were accustomed to meeting. There was in the big black
      eyes, as they had met his a moment, a suggestion of interest that was
      strangely flattering, and left a trace of not unpleasant agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo; he asked, as they passed out of hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He only thought of asking for one, although there were six, nor she
      apparently of answering differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lina Maynard. They are 'Sem.' girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a dulled voice she spoke in, quite unlike her usual eager way of
      giving information. She, poor thing, was terribly afraid he would ask her
      why they did not seem acquainted with her, and it would have been a
      painful humiliation to have explained. Arthur was conscious that he no
      longer had exactly the same feeling of merely contemptuous annoyance
      toward Lina Maynard, on account of her treatment of Amy. He sympathized as
      much with his sister, of course, but somehow felt that to be recognized by
      Lina Maynard was not such a childish ambition as he had taken for granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dusk when they reached home and found Mr. and Mrs. Steele on the
      piazza, which served as an out-door parlor in summer, with a neighbor who
      had dropped in to see Arthur. So he got out his cigar-case and told
      stories of city life and interesting law cases to an intent audience till
      the nine o'clock bell rang, and the neighbor &ldquo;guessed he 'd go home,&rdquo; and
      forthwith proved that his guess was right by going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Gad, I'd forgotten all about the watermelons! Perhaps they 're at 'em
      already!&rdquo; cried Arthur, jumping up and running around the end of the
      piazza to the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned, it was to meet a combined volley of protestations
      against his foolish project of keeping watch all night, from his father,
      his mother, and Amy. But he declared it was no use talking; and where were
      the gun and the beans? So they adjourned from the piazza, a lamp was lit,
      the articles were hunted up, and the gun duly loaded with a good charge of
      powder and a pint of hard beans. It was about ten o'clock when Arthur,
      with a parting protest from his mother, went out into the garden, lugging
      his gun and a big easy-chair, while Amy followed, bringing one or two
      wraps, and a shocking old overcoat hunted up in the garret, for the chill
      hours after midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front of Mr. Steele's lot abutted on one of the pleasantest and most
      thickly housed streets of the village; but the lot was deep, and the rear
      end rested on a road bordered by few houses, and separated from the garden
      by a rail fence easy to climb over or through. The watermelon patch was
      located close to this fence, and thus in full view and temptingly
      accessible from the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly the human conscience, and especially the boyish article,
      recognizes a broad difference between the theft of growing crops&mdash;of
      apples on the trees, for instance, or corn on the stalk, or melons in the
      field&mdash;and that of other species of property. The surreptitious
      appropriation of the former class of chattels is known in common parlance
      as &ldquo;hooking,&rdquo; while the graver term &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; describes the same process
      in other cases. The distinction may arise from a feeling that, so long as
      crops remain rooted to the ground, they are nature's, not man's, and that
      nature can't be regarded as forming business contracts with some
      individuals to the exclusion of others, or in fact as acceding to any of
      our human distinctions of <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>, however useful we
      find them. Ethical philosophers may refuse to concede the sanction of the
      popular distinction here alluded to between &ldquo;hooking&rdquo; and stealing; but,
      after all, ethics is not a deductive but an empirical science, and what
      are morals but a collection of usages, like orthography and orthoepy?
      However that may be, it is the duty of the writer in this instance merely
      to call attention to the prevalent popular sentiment on the subject,
      without any attempt to justify it, and to state that Arthur Steele had
      been too recently a boy not to sympathize with it. And accordingly he laid
      his plans to capture the expected depredators to-night from practical
      considerations wholly, and quite without any sense of moral reprobation
      toward them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Closely adjoining the edge of the melon-patch was a patch of green corn,
      standing ten feet high, and at the fullest perfection of foliage. This
      Arthur selected for his ambush, its position being such that he could cut
      off the retreat to the fence of any person who had once got among the
      melons. Hewing down a hill of corn in the second row from the front, he
      made a comfortable place for his easy-chair. Amy lingered for a while,
      enjoying the excitement of the occasion, and they talked in whispers; but
      finally Arthur sent her in, and as her dress glimmered away down the
      garden path, he settled himself comfortably for his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the faint moonlight he could just descry the dark shapes of the melons
      on the ground in front of him. The crickets were having a high time in the
      stubble around, and the night air drew sweet autumnal exhalations from the
      ground; for autumn begins by night a long time before it does by day. The
      night wind rustled in the corn with a crisp articulateness he had never
      noticed in daytime, and he felt like an eavesdropper. Then for a while he
      heard the music of some roving serenaders, down in the village, and grew
      pensive with the vague reminiscences of golden youth, romance, and the
      sweet past that nightly music suggests,&mdash;vague because apparently
      they are not reminiscences of the individual but of the race, a part of
      the consciousness and ideal of humanity. At last the music was succeeded
      by the baying of a dog in some distant farmyard, and then, ere the ocean
      of silence had fairly smoothed its surface over that, a horse began to
      kick violently in a neighboring barn. Some time after, a man chopped some
      kindlings in a shed a couple of lots off. Gradually, however, the noises
      ceased like the oft-returning yet steadily falling ebb of the tide, and
      Arthur experienced how many degrees there are of silence, each more utter
      than the last, so that the final and absolute degree must be something to
      which the utmost quiet obtainable on earth is uproar. One by one the
      lights went out in the houses, till the only ones left were in the windows
      of the Seminary, visible over the tree-tops a quarter of a mile away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girls keep late hours,&rdquo; thought Arthur. And from that he fell to
      thinking of Lina Maynard and the careless, almost insolent, grace of her
      manner, and that indifferent yet penetrating glance of hers. Where did she
      come from? Probably from California, or the far West; he had heard that
      the girls out there were of a bolder, more unconventional type than at the
      East. What a pity she did not fancy Amy!
    </p>
    <p>
      What was that moving across the melon-patch? He reached for his gun. It
      was only a cat, though, after all. The slight noise in the corn-patch
      attracted the animal's attention, and it came across and poked its head
      into the opening where Arthur sat. As the creature saw him, its start of
      surprise would have shattered the nervous system of anything but a cat. It
      stood half thrown back on its haunches, its ears flattened, its eyes
      glaring in a petrifaction of amazement. Arthur sat motionless as marble,
      laughing inwardly. For full two minutes the two stared at each other
      without moving a muscle, and then, without relaxing its tense attitude,
      the cat by almost imperceptible degrees withdrew one paw and then another,
      and, thus backing out of the corn-patch, turned around when at a safe
      distance and slunk away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later a dog, that enthusiast in perfumes, jumped through the
      fence and trotted across the melon-patch, his nose to the ground, making a
      collection of evening smells. Arthur expected nothing but that he would
      scent his neighborhood, find him out, and set up a barking. But, chancing
      to strike the cat's trail, off went the dog on a full run with nose to the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the varying humors of the night. After the episode of the dog,
      feeling a little chilly, Arthur enveloped himself in the tattered old
      overcoat and must have dropped into a nap. Suddenly he awoke. Within ten
      feet of him, just in the act of stooping over a huge melon, was a woman's
      figure. He saw the face clearly as she rose. Immortal gods! it was&mdash;But
      I am anticipating.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discipline at Westville Seminary had been shockingly lax since the
      long illness of the principal had left the easy-going first assistant
      teacher at the head of affairs. The girls ran all over the rules,&mdash;had
      private theatricals, suppers, and games of all sorts in their rooms at all
      hours of day or night. In the course of the evening whose events in
      another sphere of life have been narrated, several girls called at Lina
      Maynard's room to notify her of the &ldquo;spread&rdquo; at Nell Barber's, No. 49, at
      eleven o'clock. They found her sitting in a low rocking-chair, with an
      open letter in her hand and a very pensive, discontented expression of
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he press for an answer, Lina? We 're just in time to advise you,&rdquo;
       cried Nell Barber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't say Yes unless his eyes are blue,&rdquo; drawled a brunette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless they 're black, you mean,&rdquo; sharply amended a bright blonde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make him elope with you,&rdquo; suggested Nell, &ldquo;It will be such fun to have a
      real rope-ladder elopement at the Seminary, and we'll all sit up and see
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do, do, Lina!&rdquo; chorused the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lina, apparently too much chagrined at something to be in a mood for
      jests, sat with her eyebrows petulantly contracted, her feet thrust out,
      and the hand holding the letter hanging by her side, her whole attitude
      indicating despondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still pensive! It can't be he's faithless!&rdquo; exclaimed Nell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faithless to those eyes! I should say not,&rdquo; cried the blonde, whom Lina
      called her sweetheart, and who claimed to be &ldquo;engaged&rdquo; to her according to
      boarding-school fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't mind him, dear,&rdquo; she went on, throwing herself on the floor,
      clasping her hands about Lina's knee, and leaning her cheek on it. &ldquo;You
      make me so jealous. Have n't you got me, and ain't I enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty enough, dear,&rdquo; said Lina, stroking her cheek. &ldquo;This is only from
      my brother Charley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one at Watertown 'Sem.'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lina; &ldquo;and oh, girls,&rdquo; she went on, with gloomy energy, &ldquo;we
      don't have any good times at all compared with those boys. They do really
      wicked things, hook apples, and carry off people's gates and signs, and
      screw up tutors' doors in the night, and have fights with what he calls
      'townies,'&mdash;I don't know exactly what they are,&mdash;and everything.
      I thought before that we were doing some things too, but we 're not,
      compared with all that, and I shall be so ashamed when I meet him at home
      not to have anything to tell except little bits of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A depressing pause followed. Lina's disparaging view of achievements in
      the way of defying the proprieties, of which all the girls had been very
      proud, cast a profound gloom over the circle. The blonde seemed to voice
      the common sentiment when she said, resting her chin on Lina's knee, and
      gazing pensively at the wall:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! that comes of being girls. We might as well be good and done
      with it. We can't be bad so as to amount to anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good or bad, we must eat,&rdquo; said Nell Barber. &ldquo;I must go and get the
      spread ready. I forgot all about it, Lina; but we came in just to invite
      you. Eleven sharp, remember. Three knocks, a pause, and another, you know.
      Come, girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brunette followed her, but Lina's little sweetheart remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have they got?&rdquo; demanded the former listlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Nell has a jar of preserves from home, and I smuggled up a plate of
      dried beef from tea, and cook let us have some crackers and plates. We
      tried hard to get a watermelon there was in the pantry, but cook said she
      did n't dare let us have it. It's for dinner to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lina's eyes suddenly became introspective; then after a moment she rose
      slowly and stood in her tracks with an expression of deep thought,
      absent-mindedly took one step, then another, and after a pause a third,
      finally pulling up before the mirror, into which she stared vacantly for a
      moment, and then muttered defiantly as she turned away:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We 'll see, Master Charley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lina Maynard, what's the matter with you?&rdquo; cried the blonde, who had
      watched the pantomime with open mouth and growing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lina turned and looked at her thoughtfully a moment, and then said with
      decisiveness:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You just go to Nell's, my dear, and say I 'm coming pretty soon; and if
      you say anything else, I 'll&mdash;I 'll never marry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girls were in the habit of doing as Lina wanted them to, and the
      blonde went, pouting with unappeased curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      To gain exit from the Seminary was a simple matter in these lax days, and
      five minutes later Lina was walking rapidly along the highway, her lips
      firm set, but her eyes apprehensively reconnoitring the road ahead, with
      frequent glances to each side and behind. Once she got over the stone wall
      at the roadside in a considerable panic and crouched in the dewy grass
      while a belated villager passed, but it was without further adventure that
      she finally turned into the road leading behind Mr. Steele's lot, and
      after a brief search identified the garden where she remembered seeing
      some particularly fine melons, when out walking a day or two previous.
      There they lay, just the other side the fence, faintly visible in the dim
      light She could not help congratulating herself, by the way, on the
      excellent behavior of her nerves, whose tense, fine-strung condition was a
      positive luxury, and she then and there understood how men might delight
      in desperate risks for the mere sake of the exalted and supreme sense of
      perfect self-possession that danger brings to some natures. Not, indeed,
      that she stopped to indulge any psychological speculations. The coast was
      clear; not a footfall or hoof-stroke sounded from the road, and without
      delay she began to look about for a wide place between the rails where she
      might get through. Just as she found it, she was startled by an
      unmistakable human snore, which seemed to come from a patch of high corn
      close to the melons, and she was fairly puzzled until she observed, about
      ten rods distant in the same line, an open attic window. That explained
      its origin, and with a passing self-congratulation that she had made up
      her mind not to marry a man that snored, she began to crawl through the
      fence. When halfway through the thought struck her,&mdash;wasn't it like
      any other stealing, after all? This crawling between rails seemed
      dreadfully so. Her attitude, squeezed between two rails and half across
      the lower one, was neither graceful nor comfortable, and perhaps that fact
      shortened her scruples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can't be really stealing, for I don't feel like a thief,&rdquo; was the
      logic that settled it, and the next moment she had the novel sensation of
      having both feet surreptitiously and feloniously on another person's land.
      She decidedly did n't relish it, but she would go ahead now and think of
      it afterward. She was pretty sure she never would do it again, anyhow,
      experiencing that common sort of repentance beforehand for the thing she
      was about to do, the precise moral value of which it would be interesting
      to inquire. It ought to count for something, for, if it does n't hinder
      the act, at least it spoils the fun of it. Here was a melon at her feet;
      should she take it? That was a bigger one further on, and her imperious
      conscientiousness compelled her to go ten steps further into the enemy's
      country to get it, for now that she was committed to the undertaking, she
      was bound to do the best she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      To stoop, to break the vine, and to secure the melon were an instant's
      work; but as she bent, the high corn before her waved violently and a big
      farmer-looking man in a slouch hat and shocking old coat sprang out and
      seized her by the arm, with a grip not painful but sickeningly firm,
      exclaiming as he did so:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I swan ter gosh, if 't ain't a gal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lina dropped the melon, and, barely recalling the peculiar circumstances
      in time to suppress a scream, made a silent, desperate effort to break
      away. But her captor's hold was not even shaken, and he laughed at the
      impotence of her attempt. In all her petted life she had never been held a
      moment against her will, and it needed not the added considerations that
      this man was a coarse, unknown boor, the place retired, the time midnight,
      and herself in the position of a criminal, to give her a feeling of abject
      terror so great as to amount to positive nausea, as she realized her utter
      powerlessness in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you've been a-stealin' my melons, hey?&rdquo; he demanded gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slight shake with which the question was enforced deprived her of the
      last vestige of dignity and self-assertion. She relapsed into the mental
      condition of a juvenile culprit undergoing correction. Now that she was
      caught, she no longer thought of her offense as venial. The grasp of her
      captor seemed to put an end to all possible hairsplitting on that point,
      and prove that it was nothing more nor less than stealing, and a sense of
      guilt left her without any moral support against her fright. She was only
      conscious of utter humiliation, and an abject desire to beg off on any
      terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you go round stealin' folks's melons for, young woman? Don't yer
      folks bring yer up better 'n that? It's a dodrotted shame to 'em, ef they
      don't. What did ye want with the melons? Don't they give yer enough to eat
      ter home, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were going to have some supper, sir,&rdquo; she replied, in a scared,
      breathless tone, with a little hope of propitiating him by being extremely
      civil and explicit in her replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was havin' supper to this time er night?&rdquo; he snorted incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We girls,&rdquo; was the faint reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What gals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had she got to tell where she came from and be identified? She couldn't,
      she wouldn't. But again came that dreadful shake, and the words faltered
      out:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over at the Seminary, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew! so ye 're one er them, are ye? What's yer name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cold dew stood on the poor girl's forehead. She was silent. He might kill
      her, but she would n't disgrace her father's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's yer name?&rdquo; he repeated, with another shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still silent, though limp as a rag in his grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said he sharply, after waiting a half minute to see if she would
      answer, &ldquo;I guess ye'll be more confidin' like to the jedge when he
      inquiries in the mornin'. A night in the lock-up makes folks wonderful
      civil. Now I'll jest trouble ye to come along to the police office,&rdquo; and
      he walked her along by the arm toward the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the horrible degradation to which she was exposed flashed upon Lina,
      the last remnant of her self-control gave way, and, hanging back with all
      her might against his hand, she burst into sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't, don't! It will kill me. I'll tell you my name. It's Lina
      Maynard. My father is a rich merchant in New York, Broadway, No. 743. He
      will give you anything, if you let me go. Anything you want. Oh, please
      don't! Oh, don't! I could n't! I could n't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this terror-stricken, wild-eyed girl, her face streaming with tears,
      and every lineament convulsed with abject dread, there was little enough
      to remind Arthur Steele of the queenly maiden who had favored him with a
      glance of negligent curiosity that afternoon. He stopped marching her
      along and said reflectively:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lina Maynard, hey! Then you must be the gal that's down on Amy Steele and
      would n't ask her to the party to-morrow. Say, ain't yer the one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lina was too much bewildered by the sudden change of tack to do more than
      stammer inarticulately. I am afraid that in her terror she would have been
      capable of denying it, if she had thought that would help her. Her captor
      reflected more deeply, scratched his head, and finally, assuming a
      diplomatic attitude by thrusting his hands in his pocket, remarked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s'pose ye 'd like it dummed well ef I was to let yer go and say nothin'
      more about it. I reelly don't s'pose I 'd orter do it; but it riles me to
      see Amy comin' home cryin' every day, and I 'll tell ye what I 'll do. Ef
      you 'll ask her to yer fandango to-morrer, and be friends with her
      arterward so she 'll come home happy and cheerful like, I 'll let ye go,
      and if ye don't, I 'll put ye in jug overnight, sure's taxes. Say Yes or
      No now, quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; Lina cried, with frantic eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was scarcely any possible ransom he could have asked that she would
      not have instantly given. She dared not credit her ears, and stood gazing
      at him in intense, appealing suspense, as if he might be about to revoke
      his offer. But instead of that, he turned down the huge collar of the old
      overcoat, took it off, threw it on the ground, and, turning up the slouch
      of his hat, stood before her a very good-looking and well-dressed young
      gentleman, whom she at once recognized and at length identified in her
      mind as the one walking with Amy that afternoon, which now seemed weeks
      ago. He bowed very low, and said earnestly enough, though smiling:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I humbly beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lina stared at him with dumb amazement, and he went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Arthur Steele. I came home on a vacation to-day, and was sitting up
      to watch father's melon-patch for the pure fun of it, expecting to catch
      some small boys, and when I caught you, I couldn't resist the temptation
      of a little farce. As for Amy, that only occurred to me at the last; and
      if you think it unfair, you may have your promise back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lina had now measurably recovered her equannimity, and, ignoring his
      explanation, demanded, as she looked around:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How am I to get out of this dreadful place?&rdquo; mentally contemplating
      meanwhile the impossibility of clambering through that fence with a young
      gentleman looking on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will let down the bars,&rdquo; he said, and they turned toward the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's see, this is your melon, is it not?&rdquo; he observed, stooping to pick
      up the booty Lina had dropped in her first panic. &ldquo;You must keep that
      anyhow. You 've earned it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Since the tables turned so unexpectedly in her favor, Lina had recovered
      her dignity in some degree, and had become very freezing toward this young
      man, by whom she began to feel she had been very badly treated. In this
      reaction of indignation she had really almost forgotten how she came in
      the garden at all. But this reference to the melon quite upset her new
      equanimity, and as Arthur grinned broadly she blushed and stood there in
      awful confusion. Finally she blurted out:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't want your stupid melon. I only wanted some fun. I can't explain,
      and I don't care whether you understand it or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears of vexation glittered in her eyes. He sobered instantly, and said,
      with an air of the utmost deference:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me for laughing, and do me the justice to believe that I 'm in no
      sort of danger of misunderstanding you. I hooked too many melons myself as
      a boy not to sympathize perfectly. But you must really let me carry the
      melon home for you. What would the girls say, if you returned
      empty-handed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will take the melon,&rdquo; she said, half defiantly; &ldquo;but I should
      prefer not to have your company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply till he had let down the bars, and then said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The streets are not safe at this hour, and you 've had frights enough for
      one night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no further objections, and with the watermelon poised on his
      shoulder he walked by her side, neither speaking a word, till they reached
      the gate of the Seminary grounds. There she stopped, and, turning,
      extended her hands for the melon. As he gave it to her their eyes met a
      moment, and their mutual appreciation of the humor of the situation
      expressed itself in an irrepressible smile that seemed instantly to make
      them acquainted, and she responded almost kindly to his low
      &ldquo;Good-evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amy came home jubilant next day. Lina May-nard had invited her to her
      party, and had been ever so good to her, and there was nobody in the world
      like Lina. Arthur listened and said nothing. All the next week it was the
      same story of Lina's beauty, good-nature, cleverness, and perfections
      generally, and, above all, her goodness to herself, Amy Steele. Lina was
      indeed fulfilling her promise with generous over-measure. And after once
      taking up with Amy, the sweet simplicity and enthusiastic loyalty of the
      child to herself won her heart completely. The other girls wondered, but
      Lina Maynard's freaks always set the fashion, and Amy, to her astonishment
      and boundless delight, found herself the pet of the Seminary. The little
      blonde, Lina's sweetheart, alone rebelled against the new order of things
      and was furiously jealous, for which she was promptly snubbed by Lina, and
      Amy taken into her place. And meanwhile Lina caught herself several times
      wondering whether Arthur Steele was satisfied with the way she was keeping
      her pledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Wednesday night, and Arthur was to return to New York Thursday
      morning. Although he had walked the street every afternoon and had met
      nearly all the other girls at the Seminary, he had not seen Lina again.
      His mother, whom he took about a good deal on pleasure drives, seriously
      wondered if the eagerness of city life was really spoiling his faculty for
      leisurely pleasures. He always seemed to be looking out ahead for
      something, instead of quietly enjoying the passing sights and scenery. He
      had consented to accompany Amy to a little church sociable on the evening
      before his departure. It was a species of entertainment which he detested,
      but he thought he might possibly meet Lina there, as Amy had said some of
      the Seminary girls would be present.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once, on entering the vestry, he caught sight of her at the other end
      of the room among a group of girls. At the sound of the closing door she
      glanced up with an involuntary gesture of expectancy, and their eyes met.
      She looked confused, and instantly averted her face. There was plenty of
      recognition in her expression, but she did not bow, the real reason being
      that she was too much embarrassed to think of it. But during the week he
      had so many times canvassed the chances of her recognizing him when they
      should meet that he had become quite morbid about it, and manifested the
      usual alacrity of persons in that state of mind in jumping at conclusions
      they wish to avoid. He had been a fool to think that she would recognize
      him as an acquaintance. What had he done but to insult her, and what
      associations save distressing ones could she have with him? He would
      exchange a few greetings with old friends, and then quietly slink off home
      and go to packing up. He was rather sorry for his mother; she would feel
      so badly to have him moody and cross on the last evening at home. Just
      then some one touched his sleeve, and looking around he saw Amy. She put
      her flushed little face close to his ear and whispered:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lina said I might introduce you. Is n't she beautiful, though, to-night?
      Of course you 'll fall in love with her, but you must n't try to cut me
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur was Amy's ideal of gentlemanly ease and polish, and she had been
      very proud of having so fine a city brother to introduce to the girls.
      Imagine her astonishment and chagrin when she saw him standing before Lina
      with an exaggeration of the agitated, sheepish air the girls made such fun
      of in their rural admirers! But if that surprised her, what was her
      amazement to see Lina looking equally confused, and blushing to where her
      neck curved beneath the lace, although the brave eyes met his fairly! A
      wise instinct told Amy that here was something she didn't understand, and
      she had better go away, and she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The melon was very good, Mr. Steele,&rdquo; said Lina demurely, with a glimmer
      of fun in her black eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Maynard, I don't know how I shall beg pardon, or humble myself
      enough for my outrageous treatment of you,&rdquo; burst forth Arthur. &ldquo;I don't
      know what I should have done if I had n't had an opportunity for
      apologizing pretty soon, and now I scarcely dare look you in the face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His chagrin and self-reproach were genuine enough, but he might have left
      off that last, for he had n't been looking anywhere else since he came
      into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did shake me rather hard,&rdquo; she said, with a smiling contraction of
      the black eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good heavens! had he actually shaken this divine creature,&mdash;this
      Cleopatra of a girl, whose queenly brow gave her hair the look of a
      coronet! He groaned in spirit, and looked so self-reproachful and
      chagrined that she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know about forgiving you for that, but I 'm so grateful you did
      n't take me to the lock-up that I suppose I ought not to mind the
      shaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Miss Maynard, you surely don't think I was in earnest about that?&rdquo;
       he exclaimed, in strenuous deprecation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, I 'm sure,&rdquo; she said doubtfully. &ldquo;You looked as if you were
      capable of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was going on to protest still farther when she interrupted him, and
      said laughingly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take to apologizing so naturally that I 'd nearly forgotten that it
      was not you but I who was the real culprit. I must really make a few
      excuses myself before I hear any more from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then she told him all about her brother Charley's letter, and the
      spirit of emulation that had got her into trouble. It was easy enough to
      joke about certain aspects of the matter; but when she came to talk in
      plain language about her performances that night, she became so much
      embarrassed and stumbled so badly that Arthur felt very ill at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when I think what <i>would</i> have happened if I 'd fallen into
      anybody's hands but yours, you seem almost like a deliverer.&rdquo; At which
      Arthur had another access of humiliation to think how un-chivalrously he
      had treated this princess in disguise. How he would like to catch somebody
      else abusing her that way! And then he told her all that he had thought
      and felt about her during the stealing scene, and she gave her side of the
      drama, to their intense mutual interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is n't it about time we were going home, Arthur?&rdquo; said Amy's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced up. The room was nearly empty, and the party from the Seminary
      were waiting for Lina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Maynard, may I call upon you in New York during vacation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be happy to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Au revoir</i>, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Au revoir!</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Au revoir!</i>&rdquo; <br /> <br />
    </p>
